# Using a list comprehension create a list of tuples from the folowing datastructure
{‘a’: ‘Alpha’, ‘b’ : ‘Beta’, ‘g’: ‘Gamma’}

 

# From these 2 sets:
{'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'y'}

{'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'y', 'æ' ,'ø', 'å'}

 

Of the 2 sets create a:

# Date Decoder.
A date of the form 8-MAR-85 includes the name of the month, which must be translated to a number.

Create a dict suitable for decoding month names to numbers.

Create a function which uses string operations to split the date into 3 items using the "-" character.

Translate the month, correct the year to include all of the digits.

 

The function will accept a date in the "dd-MMM-yy" format and respond with a tuple of ( y , m , d ).
